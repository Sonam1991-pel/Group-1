Key Models
1. Supervised Learning Models:
o Random Forests and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for classifying network traffic as normal or malicious.
o Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for intrusion detection.

2. Unsupervised Learning Models:
o Autoencoders for anomaly detection by identifying deviations from learned normal patterns.
o Clustering algorithms like K-Means to detect unusual network behaviour without labeled data.

3. Hybrid Models:
o Combining supervised and unsupervised learning to detect both known and unknown threats.

4. Reinforcement Learning: For adaptive models that improve over time by learning from feedback in real-time detection scenarios.

5. Self-Evolving Detection Systems (SEDS):
o Incorporate machine learning (ML) and deep learning for continuous adaptation to new threats, leveraging large-scale threat intelligence datasets​
